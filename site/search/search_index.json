Note Certain parts of the plugin are not included in the api. They be being added however you will have to use the internal plugin to access them in the mean time Tip All of the methods and classes have taliored descriptions (Javadocs). You can use IntelliSense the view them inside your ide or navigate it's webpage to look at them Setup First of all you need to add the api as a dependency to your project Dependency Maven 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <!--- No repo needed! ---> <dependency> <groupId> wtf.nucker </groupId> <artifactId> KitPvPPlus-API </artifactId> <version> 1.0.0 </version> <scope> provided </scope> </dependency> Gradle 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { compileOnly \"wtf.nucker:KitPvPPlus-API:1.0.0\" } API Access You can now use the api! In our main class we can do this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 public class Main extends JavaPlugin { private KitPvPPlusAPI api ; public void onEnable () { this . api = KitPvPPlusAPI . getInstance (); } public KitPvPPlusAPI getApi () { return this . api ; } } Player Data You can access the data stored about players, such as kills, exp etcetera through a useful interface. To access you can do the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 public void onEnable () { // Start up logic KitPvPPlusAPI api = KitPvPPlusAPI . getInstance (); PlayerData data = api . getPlayerData ( UUID . fromString ( \"68f34c4f-d00c-40fb-858d-b5a876601072\" )); } There, as simple as that! You can use your IDE's auto-suggest features to see what you can access. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 public void onEnable () { // Start up logic KitPvPPlusAPI api = KitPvPPlusAPI . getInstance (); PlayerData data = api . getPlayerData ( UUID . fromString ( \"68f34c4f-d00c-40fb-858d-b5a876601072\" )); int kills = data . getKills (); data . setState ( PlayerState . SPAWN ); } Event Listeners The API usefully adds some bukkit events so you can run code when certain things happen Example Using bukkit events: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 public class MyListener implements Listner { @EventHandler public void onEvent ( EventClass event ) { // Code.. } } And in your main class: 1 2 3 4 5 public void onEnable () { // Startup logic... getServer (). getPluginManager (). registerEvents ( new MyListener , this ); } Event Class name Description AbilityActivateEvent Called when a player activates an event KitLoadEvent Called when someone loads the event StateChangeEvent Called when the player's state changes Custom abilities Though players are limited to the ablities that come with the plugin. However you create your own! Creating your ability First of all we need to create a new class for our ability. It also needs to extend the Ability class 1 2 3 public class ExampleAbility extends Ability { } You might get some errors but we'll fix them now. We're going to add a constructor to our class that looks something like this 1 2 3 public ExampleAbility () { super ( \"example_ability\" , new ItemStack ( Material . APPLE )); } The first paramater of the super method is the id of our ability. The second one is the itemstack for the ability. Warning The id of the ability must be unique. It will conflict with other abilities otherwise. Next up, we need to add method that runs when the ability is activated. We can add this 1 2 3 4 @Override public void onActivate ( ItemStack item , Ability ability , PlayerInteractEvent event ) { // Code goes here } The final thing to do is go into your main class and in the onEnable method add the following line of code: 1 2 3 4 public void onEnable () { KitPvPPlusAPI api = KitPvPPlusAPI . getInstance (); api . registerAbility ( new ExampleAbility ()); } In the end, your ability class should look like this: Example Warning If you just copy and paste this, please just read the code to understand what everything does. Please, for your own sake 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 public class ExampleAbility extends Ability { public ExampleAbility () { super ( \"example_ability\" , new ItemStack ( Material . APPLE )); } @Override public void onActivate ( ItemStack item , Ability ability , PlayerInteractEvent event ) { } } Decreasing item amount Similar to the TNT Shooter ability in the default plugin, your ability can work where you have x amount of items and decrease them every time they're used. Essentially in your onActivate method in your ability class, once you've called all your code you can add this: 1 2 3 4 5 @Override public void onActivate ( ItemStack item , Ability ability , PlayerInteractEvent event ) { // Code... decreaseItem ( item ); } Ability cooldowns You can easily implement cooldowns into your ability with one line of code! This is similar to the Sonic ability in the default plugin. 1 2 3 4 5 @Override public void onActivate ( ItemStack item , Ability ability , PlayerInteractEvent event ) { // Code... putOnCooldown ( event . getPlayer (), 60 ); } This will put the player on cooldown for using this ability for 60 seconds aka a minute. Tip You can easily convert times using the TimeUnit class in java. For example: 1 TimeUnit . HOURS . toSeconds ( 2 ); This will return 2 hours in seconds! Locations You can actually access the locations used in KitPvPPlus such as spawn and the arena! Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 public void onEnable () { // On enable logic... KitPvPPlusAPI api = KitPvPPlusAPI . getInstance (); // Get instance of api instance getServer (). getOnlinePlayers (). forEach ( player -> { // Get online players and loop through player . teleport ( api . getLocations (). getSpawn ()); // Teleport them to the spawn location }); } Config You can access all data from the config files through the api Danger You cannot set data within the config files. Unless you go into the config instance, there is no way of accessing the raw config file Example 1 2 3 4 public void onEnable () { KitPvPPlusAPI api = KitPvPPlusAPI . getInstance (); // Get instance of the API System . out . println ( api . getConfigs (). getMessage ( \"general.permission-message\" ). getAsString ()); // Get the permission message from messages.yml as string object } Getting data from the other configs is pretty similar Leaderboards You can access information about leaderboards so you can intergrate them into your plugin and add features. Example Getting the leaderboard manager 1 2 3 4 public void onEnable () { KitPvPPlusAPI api = KitPvPPlusAPI . getInstance (); // Get instance of the API LeaderboardManager manager = api . getLeaderboardManager (); // Get the leaderboard manager } We can now get, for example, the deaths leaderboard: 1 2 3 4 5 public void onEnable () { KitPvPPlusAPI api = KitPvPPlusAPI . getInstance (); // Get instance of the API LeaderboardManager manager = api . getLeaderboardManager (); // Get the leaderboard manager Leaderboard lb = manager . getDeathsLeaderboard (); } Here are some examples of how we can get information: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 public void onEnable () { ... // See above for code List < LeaderboardValue > topTen = lb . getTop ( 10 ); // Returns the top 10 spots on the leaderboard Player examplePlayer = Bukkit . getOfflinePlayer ( \"Notch\" ); int place = lb . getPlace ( examplePlayer ); // Returns notch's place in the leaderboard. } Coming soon Feature ETA Ability Manager None Kit Manager None Found a problem?

Danger If you edit the actual kits.yml file, there is a high risk of you losing all your kits due to a syntax error. Step one First of all your gonna want to create the kit. You can do this by running 1 /kit create <kitname> Example Step two You can now set the contents of the kit. Put all the items you want in your inventory and run 1 /kit set contents <kitname> Example Step three (Optional) You can set an icon. This is the item type that appears in the kit gui (if you have the enabled). You can set it by running 1 /kit set icon <kitname> This will set the icon of the kit to what ever item type is in your hand. This will also set the lore/description from the item Example Step four Setting the permission allows you to limit access to the kit to only people with the certain permission. Its pretty simple, its just 1 /kit set permission <kitname> <permission> Tip You can set no permission by just doing 1 /kit set permission <kitname> Step 5 The rest is pretty self-explanatory.
