Note Certain parts of the plugin are not included in the api. They be being added however you will have to use the internal plugin to access them in the mean time Setup First of all you need to add the api as a dependency to your project Dependency Maven 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <repository> <id> jitpack.io </id> <url> https://jitpack.io </url> </repository> <dependency> <groupId> wtf.nucker.kitpvpplus </groupId> <artifactId> API </artifactId> <version> 1.0 </version> </dependency> Gradle 1 2 3 maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } compile group: 'wtf.nucker.kitpvpplus', name: 'API', version:'1.0' API Access You can now use the api! In our main class we can do this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 public class Main extends JavaPlugin { private KitPvPPlusAPI api ; public void onEnable () { this . api = KitPvPPlusAPI . getInstance (); } public KitPvPPlusAPI getApi () { return this . api ; } } Custom abilities Though players are limited to the ablities that come with the plugin. However you create your own! Creating your ability First of all we need to create a new class for our ability. It also needs to extend the Ability class 1 2 3 public class ExampleAbility extends Ability { } You might get some errors but we'll fix them now. We're going to add a constructor to our class that looks something like this 1 2 3 public ExampleAbility () { super ( \"example_ability\" , new ItemStack ( Material . APPLE )); } The first paramater of the super method is the id of our ability. The second one is the itemstack for the ability. Warning The id of the ability must be unique. It will conflict with other abilities otherwise. Next up, we need to add method that runs when the ability is activated. We can add this 1 2 3 4 @Override public void onActivate ( ItemStack item , Ability ability , PlayerInteractEvent event ) { // Code goes here } The final thing to do is go into your main class and in the onEnable method add the following line of code: 1 2 3 4 public void onEnable () { KitPvPPlusAPI api = KitPvPPlusAPI . getInstance (); api . registerAbility ( new ExampleAbility ()); } In the end, your ability class should look like this: Example Warning If you just copy and paste this, please just read the code to understand what everything does. Please, for your own sake 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 public class ExampleAbility extends Ability { public ExampleAbility () { super ( \"example_ability\" , new ItemStack ( Material . APPLE )); } @Override public void onActivate ( ItemStack item , Ability ability , PlayerInteractEvent event ) { } } Decreasing item amount Similar to the TNT Shooter ability in the default plugin, your ability can work where you have x amount of items and decrease them every time they're used. Essentially in your onActivate method in your ability class, once you've called all your code you can add this: 1 2 3 4 5 @Override public void onActivate ( ItemStack item , Ability ability , PlayerInteractEvent event ) { // Code... decreaseItem ( item ); } Ability cooldowns You can easily implement cooldowns into your ability with one line of code! This is similar to the Sonic ability in the default plugin. 1 2 3 4 5 @Override public void onActivate ( ItemStack item , Ability ability , PlayerInteractEvent event ) { // Code... putOnCooldown ( event . getPlayer (), 60 ); } This will put the player on cooldown for using this ability for 60 seconds aka a minute. Tip You can easily convert times using the TimeUnit class in java. For example: 1 TimeUnit . HOURS . toSeconds ( 2 ); This will return 2 hours in seconds! Locations You can actually access the locations used in KitPvPPlus such as spawn and the arena! Example ```java public void onEnable() { // On enable logic... KitPvPPlusAPI api = KitPvPPlusAPI.getInstance(); // Get instance of api instance 1 2 3 getServer().getOnlinePlayers().forEach(player -> { // Get online players and loop through player.teleport(api.getLocations().getSpawn()); // Teleport them to the spawn location }); } ``` Config You can access all data from the config files through the api Danger You cannot set data within the config files. Unless you go into the config instance, there is no way of accessing the raw config file Example 1 2 3 4 public void onEnable () { KitPvPPlusAPI api = KitPvPPlusAPI . getInstance (); // Get instance of the API System . out . println ( api . getConfigs (). getMessage ( \"general.permission-message\" ). getAsString ()); // Get the permission message from messages.yml as string object } Getting data from the other configs is pretty similar Coming soon Feature ETA Ability Manager None Kit Manager None","title":"Plugin API"},{"location":"plugin-api/#plugin-api","text":"The api allows you to intergrate your plugin with KitPvP Plus.

HOURS . toSeconds ( 2 ); This will return 2 hours in seconds!","title":"Ability cooldowns"},{"location":"plugin-api/#locations","text":"You can actually access the locations used in KitPvPPlus such as spawn and the arena!
